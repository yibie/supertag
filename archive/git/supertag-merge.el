;;; supertag-merge.el --- Pure 3-way semantic merge core for supertag-db.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; S3a of archive/legacy-v2/2026-08-25-phrase/phases/phase-git-sync-20260713/PLAN.md ("S3 语义 merge
;; driver"): the pure, side-effect-free merge core, plus a thin batch driver
;; entry point.  This file deliberately does NOT implement `supertag-git-setup',
;; `.gitattributes' handling, or `doctor' integration -- that is S3b.
;;
;; ## What this file assumes about the on-disk format (FROZEN, do not
;; reinterpret): the S2 canonical, deterministic, line-per-entity format
;; documented above `supertag--persistence-canonical-format-header' in
;; supertag-core-persistence.el, plus the legacy single-`prin1'-of-a-hash-table
;; format it transparently falls back to.  Both are read via
;; `supertag--persistence--try-read-store', which this file requires rather
;; than re-implementing a parser -- per the plan's explicit instruction to
;; reuse, not duplicate, the S2 reader/writer/equality primitives.
;;
;; ## Decision table (normative; copied here only for cross-reference -- the
;; source of truth is the plan's "S3 语义 merge driver" -> "合并算法" table):
;;
;;   base | ours | theirs | result
;;   -----|------|--------|-------
;;   A    | A    | A      | A                          (unchanged)
;;   A    | B    | A      | B                          (ours changed)
;;   A    | A    | C      | C                          (theirs changed)
;;   A    | B    | B      | B                          (both changed, same)
;;   A    | B    | C      | field-level 3-way on the entity plist
;;   A    | del  | A      | deleted
;;   A    | del  | C      | resurrect C + delete-vs-modify conflict
;;   none | B    | C      | field-level 3-way (no base fields)
;;
;; Root scalars (e.g. `:version') follow the exact same per-key rules, with
;; one addition: a genuine `:version' conflict is resolved by taking the
;; higher of the two versions (`supertag-merge--higher-version', via
;; `version<') rather than an arbitrary side, still with a conflict record.
;;
;; ## Equality
;;
;; "Equal" always means `equal' on values run through
;; `supertag--persistence--canonicalize-value' first (recursively sorts plist
;; keys and freezes nested hash tables into a comparable, re-readable form) --
;; this IS the S2-frozen definition of value equality, reused rather than
;; redefined, so a false conflict can never arise merely from plist key order
;; or hash-table iteration order differing between two independently-written
;; files.
;;
;; A deliberate, narrower design choice specific to this file: at the FIELD
;; level (inside one entity, or inside the root scalar plist), a key that is
;; simply ABSENT from a plist is treated as equivalent to that key being
;; PRESENT with value nil (both read back as nil via `plist-get').  This is
;; what makes "nil-vs-missing" a non-conflict, per the plan's field-type
;; equality matrix.  This collapse is intentionally *not* applied at the
;; entity/collection level: an entity's presence or absence in a collection's
;; id -> data map is a real fact (added/deleted), tracked with a distinct
;; internal sentinel, `supertag-merge--absent', that never leaks into merged
;; output (see `supertag-merge--printable').
;;
;; ## Conflict granularity
;;
;; NOT every entity value is a plist.  `:tag-field-associations' entity
;; values are ORDERED LISTS OF PLISTS (tag-id -> a list of `(:field-id ID
;; :order N)' association plists) -- decomposing that shape with plain
;; `plist-get'/`plist-put' (as an earlier version of this file did
;; unconditionally for every conflicting entity) silently produces
;; interleaved garbage, because a proper, even-length list of PLISTS looks
;; superficially plist-shaped by length alone; it is not, since its
;; elements are not keywords.  Every entity-level conflict therefore goes
;; through `supertag-merge--decompose-conflict', which dispatches on
;; COLLECTION identity and shape rather than assuming a plist:
;;
;;   1. `:tag-field-associations' (dispatched by COLLECTION, not shape):
;;      `supertag-merge--merge-tag-field-associations' merges as an ordered
;;      set keyed by the stable `:field-id' of each association -- a
;;      field-id touched by only one side's diff from base is included as
;;      that side left it; the same field-id changed differently on both
;;      sides is a whole-association (not sub-field) conflict for that
;;      field-id.  Concurrent ordering constraints are combined when possible;
;;      incompatible orders keep ours as the complete fallback and record one
;;      `:order' conflict containing all three original orders.
;;   2. Positively plist-shaped entities (per `supertag--persistence--plist-p',
;;      REUSED rather than reinvented -- the exact same conservative
;;      discriminator the canonicalizer already uses to decide this exact
;;      question: a proper, non-empty, even-length list whose element at
;;      EVERY even index, not merely the first, is a keyword; checking only
;;      the first element is not sufficient -- the `:tag-field-associations'
;;      shape above has a plist, not a keyword, at index 0, and a naive
;;      first-element check would misclassify it): "field-level 3-way on
;;      the entity plist" as before -- when an entity's plist keys differ
;;      between ours and theirs, each KEY is decided independently via the
;;      same 3-way rule: two sides agreeing but differing from base -> that
;;      value; both sides disagreeing with each other -> a true, per-key
;;      conflict.  Keys are not recursively decomposed further even if a
;;      key's value happens to itself be a nested PLIST -- "same key, both
;;      sides changed it differently" already IS the true conflict at that
;;      key, per the plan.  A handful of collections (`:field-values', and
;;      the legacy `:fields') store each entity's data as a raw (frozen)
;;      hash table rather than a plist; those are naturally still covered
;;      by the exact same per-"key" logic once frozen (a frozen hash table
;;      prints as `(:supertag-hash-table ((K . V) ...))', which -- being
;;      itself a genuine 2-element plist with one keyword key -- the
;;      plist-shaped field walk sees as a single pseudo-key).
;;
;;      UNLIKE a nested PLIST value (never decomposed further, above), the
;;      pseudo-key's VALUE here is not a plist at all -- it is the frozen
;;      hash table's own `(KEY . VALUE)' ALIST, i.e. exactly the map this
;;      collection actually stores.  A conflict at this pseudo-key
;;      therefore recurses one level further, map-style, keyed by each
;;      ALIST entry's own KEY (`supertag-merge--merge-hash-marker-map'):
;;      a key touched by only one side is adopted without conflict -- this
;;      is what makes the flagship dogfood scenario (machine A sets field
;;      "priority", machine B concurrently sets field "deadline" on the
;;      SAME node/tag) merge cleanly instead of colliding as one
;;      whole-entity conflict; the same key changed differently on both
;;      sides recurses AGAIN, exactly the same way, when BOTH sides'
;;      values for it are themselves hash-marker forms -- this is what
;;      makes the legacy `:fields' collection's node -> tag -> field
;;      nesting merge field-by-field even when two machines touch
;;      different fields under the SAME tag; otherwise (a genuine,
;;      non-map leaf disagreement) it is the true, per-key-path conflict,
;;      the recursion's own safety net, one level at a time, all the way
;;      down.  See `supertag-merge--merge-hash-marker-map' and
;;      `supertag-merge--merge-hash-map-entry' below, and merge-test.el's
;;      dedicated tests for this, including the regression test pinning
;;      the now-narrower case where a hash-shaped entity's conflict is
;;      STILL whole-leaf-value granularity (because the disagreeing leaf
;;      itself is not a nested map on both sides).
;;   3. Anything else -- NEVER guessed to be a plist -- gets whole-value
;;      3-way: a conflicting entity becomes one whole-entity conflict
;;      record (`:kind :field-conflict', `:key' nil), with ours written in
;;      place (the same ours-preference tiebreak used everywhere else in
;;      this file when `:modified-at' does not decide a winner).  This is
;;      the safety net that makes any future, not-yet-invented collection
;;      shape safe by construction instead of by omission.
;;
;; Zero data is ever lost in any of the three paths: both full sides always
;; survive intact in the conflict record, even when the entity/field/slot
;; written into the merged store prefers one side over the other.
;;
;; ## Conflict representation
;;
;; True conflicts are never written as git-style conflict markers inside the
;; data file (the loader would refuse to parse it).  Instead each becomes one
;; entity in a new collection, `:sync-conflicts', with a deterministic id
;; (`supertag-merge--conflict-id') of the shape:
;;   "COLLECTION/ENTITY-ID/KEY"   (a field-level conflict)
;;   "tag-field-associations/ENTITY-ID/field|meta/KEY"
;;                                  (association slot vs list metadata)
;;   "COLLECTION/ENTITY-ID"       (a delete-vs-modify conflict; no single key)
;;   "root/KEY"                   (a root-scalar conflict, e.g. "root/version")
;;   "COLLECTION/ENTITY-ID/SEG1/SEG2/.../SEGN"
;;                                  (a conflict at a leaf inside a frozen
;;                                  hash-marker map, e.g.
;;                                  "fields/NODE-ID/TAG-ID/FIELD-NAME" --
;;                                  see `supertag-merge--merge-hash-marker-map'
;;                                  and `supertag-merge--make-path-conflict')
;; Determinism of the id is what makes re-merging idempotent: the same three
;; inputs always produce the same conflict ids (and, since everything else in
;; this file is equally deterministic, byte-identical merged output).
;;
;; Each conflict entity's data is:
;;   (:id ID :collection C :entity-id ID-OR-NIL :key K-OR-NIL
;;    :ours V1 :theirs V2 :base V0 :kind :field-conflict|:delete-vs-modify
;;    :detected-at nil)
;; A nested hash-marker-map conflict (the last id shape above) additionally
;; carries `:key-path PATH', a list of the ALIST keys from the entity down to
;; the conflicting leaf (e.g. `("TAG-ID" "FIELD-NAME")'); `:key' itself is
;; still set to PATH's own last (leaf) element, so the record's `:collection'
;; /`:entity-id'/`:key' triple alone already reads exactly like an ordinary,
;; non-nested field-conflict record on this collection -- `:key-path' is
;; purely additive, for anything that wants the full nesting instead of just
;; the leaf.  IMPORTANT, READ BEFORE WIRING UP RESOLUTION: this file's sibling
;; supertag-conflicts.el pre-dates this key-path shape entirely and was
;; audited (not modified -- see that file, which this one deliberately does
;; not `require') against it: its dispatch would send such a record down the
;; ordinary per-key `supertag-conflicts--apply' path (COLLECTION non-nil,
;; KEY non-nil and not the hash marker), which assumes the live entity is a
;; PLIST and calls `plist-put' on it -- but `:fields'/`:field-values'
;; entities are genuinely raw hash tables live, not plists, so resolving one
;; of these new leaf conflicts interactively today fails loudly (a
;; `wrong-type-argument' from `plist-put', caught and reported per-conflict
;; by the bulk resolvers, or signaled back to the interactive caller) rather
;; than corrupting the entity or silently doing nothing.  `:drop' (discard
;; the stale conflict record without touching the target) still works fine.
;; Teaching supertag-conflicts.el to apply `:key-path' against the real
;; nested hash tables is intentionally left as followup work, not done here.
;; `:detected-at' is always nil in this file: a merge driver run must be a
;; pure function of its three inputs (see the idempotence test), and a
;; wall-clock timestamp would break that.  A live/interactive caller (S3b or
;; later) is free to backfill `:detected-at' non-destructively; this module
;; never does.
;;
;; The value written into the entity itself at a conflicting key (the
;; "winning" value users see by default) prefers whichever side's entity-level
;; `:modified-at' is strictly newer (`supertag-merge--newer-side', via
;; `time-less-p' on the standard 4-integer Emacs time list); when not
;; comparable (missing, equal, or malformed on either side) it falls back to
;; ours.  This is purely a display/default choice -- BOTH values always
;; remain fully present in the conflict record, so nothing is ever silently
;; lost.
;;
;; ## Require chain (kept minimal on purpose)
;;
;; This file requires only `supertag-core-persistence', whose own chain is:
;; `supertag-core-notify' -> `supertag-core-store' -> `supertag-core-index' ->
;; `supertag-core-transform' (plus `cl-lib'/`ht'/`json'/`parse-time', all
;; either built in or a normal package.el dependency).  Collectively this is
;; ~2800 lines of pure data-structure/persistence code.  It does NOT require
;; or load `supertag.el' itself, so no UI, no `org' integration, no
;; automation, and no view code is ever pulled in.
;;
;; Loading this chain has exactly one top-level (load-time) side effect
;; anywhere in it: `supertag-core-persistence.el' calls `(supertag-subscribe
;; :store-changed #'supertag-persistence--handle-store-changed)' at load time.
;; That handler only *fires* when something calls the mutating
;; `supertag-put'/`supertag-update' style API to change `supertag--store' --
;; this file never does (it reads plain hash tables with
;; `supertag--persistence--try-read-store' and builds its own local hash
;; tables directly), so in this process that subscription is registered but
;; never invoked.  No timer is started, no database is loaded, and no
;; `data-directory' file is touched, purely by requiring this chain.
;;
;; `ht' itself is expected to already be installed as a normal ELPA package
;; (as it is for every other supertag module); since `-Q' skips init
;; files but does NOT change `package-user-dir', this file calls
;; `(package-initialize)' itself, guarded, before requiring the supertag
;; chain below -- so the driver invocation does not also need `-L' to point
;; at ht's install directory, only at this repository's own directory.
;;
;; Git invocation (S3b wires this up automatically via `supertag-git-setup';
;; documented here so this file is independently testable/usable meanwhile):
;;
;;   emacs -Q --batch -L <supertag-dir> -l supertag-merge.el \
;;         -f supertag-merge-driver-main %O %A %B
;;
;; Per the git merge-driver protocol, %O/%A/%B are BASE/OURS/THEIRS; the
;; result must be written back over %A (OURS); exit 0 means "merged
;; successfully" (which, per this file's design, is true even when
;; conflicts were recorded -- those are data for the user to resolve later,
;; not driver failures); exit 1 means "could not merge", and git falls back
;; to its own default text merge.  On any parse or internal error this file
;; leaves OURS byte-for-byte untouched.

BASE may be `supertag-merge--absent' (no common-ancestor entity at all);
OURS/THEIRS are real plists that differ overall.  NEWER-SIDE is `:ours' or
`:theirs', from `supertag-merge--newer-side', used to pick the value
written into the merged entity at each conflicting key -- both sides
always additionally survive intact in the conflict record.

Special-cased for the single `:supertag-hash-table' pseudo-key produced
when the whole entity is a frozen hash-table map (`:field-values', legacy
`:fields'; see this file's Commentary \"Conflict granularity\"): a
conflict AT that key does not become one whole-entity conflict record the
way an ordinary plist key's conflict would -- OV/TV at that key are
already the frozen map's own ALIST (not re-wrapped), so it recurses,
map-key-by-map-key, via `supertag-merge--merge-hash-marker-map', and the
merged ALIST is re-wrapped back into marker form for the entity's merged
value.  Any other key's conflict (including a non-map value inside a
hash-marker map recursing down to a genuine leaf) still becomes a plain
field-conflict record, unchanged from before.

BASE/OURS/THEIRS genuinely differ from each other (the caller has already

Dispatches:
  1. By COLLECTION identity first: `:tag-field-associations' values are
     ORDERED LISTS OF PLISTS, not plists themselves, so they get their own
     ordered-set-by-`:field-id' merge rather than ever being decomposed
     with `plist-get'/`plist-put'.
  2. Otherwise, only when BASE/OURS/THEIRS are ALL positively plist-shaped
     (`supertag-merge--plist-like-p', never guessed): per-key field-level
     3-way, as before.
  3. Otherwise (anything not positively identified as one of the above --
     the safety net): whole-value 3-way.  One whole-entity conflict record
     is emitted (`:kind :field-conflict', `:key' nil), and the value

only (collection values, e.g. `:tag-field-associations', live in

value.  Each individual root KEY's VALUE (bv/ov/tv below), by contrast, is
never itself decomposed as a plist: a conflicting value is always taken
whole -- either `supertag-merge--higher-version' for `:version', or the

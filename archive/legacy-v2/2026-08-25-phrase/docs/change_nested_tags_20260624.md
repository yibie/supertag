# change_nested_tags_20260624

## 2026-08-11 (task025)

- **Action**: Treat `/` as an explicit inline completion operator for creating one child under an existing parent display path.
- **Behavior**: `#diary/happy [New]` creates only `happy :extends diary`, relates the current node to `happy`, then writes `#happy`; same-parent children are reused and conflicts are shown without reparenting.
- **Atomicity**: One transaction covers Tag/node/relation writes plus buffer normalization; body completion synchronizes from the owning heading, and failures restore the input token and any newly generated Org ID.
- **Validation**: Shared Tag Ops rejects missing nodes; new leaves use the existing inline-Tag predicate; an empty allowed-parent set cannot fall back to the full Store.
- **Simplification**: Reused CAPF properties, display-path resolution, Tag Ops and `:extends`; no slash ID, intermediate-parent creation, schema field, cache or dependency.
- **Verification**: public CAPF/Store matrix; Tag Path 39/39; Smart Key 12/12; clean-worktree full ERT 416/416; completion self-check; byte compile, paren/diff checks and zero repo `.elc`; independent standards/spec re-reviews both APPROVE.
- **Remaining**: issue009 remains open for user-visible confirmation.

## 2026-08-07 (task023)

- **Action**: Make `:extends` the only hierarchy and descendant-query source; migrate the live Store's two slash IDs.
- **Behavior**: Stream/View/Table aggregate transitive children, Schema renders only real Tag nodes, and new/renamed/synchronized Tag IDs cannot contain `/`; parent display paths still resolve to their real leaf IDs.
- **Data**: Migrated `Apple/Shortcut/语言` and `coding/日志`, rewrote their source Org tokens, and retained a unique pre-migration database snapshot.
- **Verification**: focused ERT 84/84; full ERT 399/399; non-writing byte compile and `check-parens`; live `diary` exact 2 → descendant scope 256; slash IDs 2 → 0.
- **Remaining**: issue009 stays open only for the user's live Stream/Schema confirmation.

## 2026-08-04 (task022)

- **Action**: Keep the first real completion above the explicit `[New]` action in actual Corfu sorting.
- **Behavior**: `#dia` renders `diary` first, `dia [New]` second, then the remaining matching children.
- **Simplification**: A hidden non-exact marker avoids Corfu's forced exact promotion; the existing affixation and exit normalization hide/remove it.
- **Verification**: focused ERT 22/22; completion self-check; live `corfu--compute` order and formatter passed; full ERT and static checks.

## 2026-08-03 (task021)

- **Action**: Require explicit `[New]` selection before inline completion can register a new Tag.
- **Behavior**: `#dia` completes toward `diary`; cancellation or a delimiter performs no new-Tag write. task022 later places `dia [New]` second.
- **Simplification**: The existing `is-new-tag` property is the creation capability; no second confirmation state or UI advice.
- **Verification**: focused ERT 22/22; completion self-check; full ERT 354/354; live Corfu showed `diary` first and `dia [New]` last; byte compile and static checks passed.

## 2026-08-03 (task020)

- **Action**: Let parent input progressively enumerate its real `:extends` children.
- **Behavior**: `#diary` and `#diary/` show `diary/happy`; selecting it replaces the visual alias with `#happy` before synchronization or persistence.
- **Simplification**: Derive aliases only for the live prefix and reuse the existing real-ID text property; no new Store state.
- **Verification**: focused ERT 21/21; full ERT 353/353; live Corfu enumeration/formatting passed; real full-path collision remains bound to its own ID; byte compile and static checks passed.

## 2026-08-03 (task019)

- **Action**: Fix the Corfu crash caused by a `nil` affixation suffix.
- **Behavior**: Every affixation row is now `(string string string)`; ordinary candidates use `""`, new candidates retain `[New]`.
- **Simplification**: Corrected the shared row producer instead of adding a Corfu-specific workaround.
- **Verification**: red/green focused ERT 19/19; full ERT 351/351; live Corfu formatter accepted both ordinary and new candidates; byte compile and static checks passed.

## 2026-08-03 (task018)

- **Action**: Unify nested Tag completion and Schema around the existing `:extends` parent relation.
- **Files**: Modify path helpers, Tag Ops, shared UI reader, inline completion, Schema View, focused tests and phase/docs.
- **Behavior**: `happy` is searchable directly and displayed as `diary/happy`; selection still writes `happy`. Schema renders `happy` inside `diary` and uses slash paths only as a fallback for legacy full-path IDs.
- **Simplification**: Removed stepwise namespace navigation, the duplicate path-child creation command and arrow-style parent display; reused Emacs affixation and the existing Child Tag operation.
- **Verification**: focused ERT 19/19; full ERT 351/351; live Store confirmed parent/display/CAPF/Schema behavior; byte compilation, `check-parens`, `git diff --check`; no repository `.elc`.
- **Cleanup**: Removed orphan `diary/happy` after source, Store and reference checks; recoverable from `/private/tmp/supertag-db.el.before-diary-slash-happy-cleanup-20260803`; notes commit `b7bfdfe` pushed.
- **Remaining**: issue009 stays open for live popup and Schema View acceptance.

## 2026-08-03 (task017)

- **Action**: Let an existing flat Tag open its child namespace from inline completion.
- **Files**: Modify `supertag-ui-completion.el`, `test/tag-path-test.el` and nested-tag phase/docs.
- **Behavior**: Typing `#diary` offers `diary/` even before any `diary/...` Tag exists; the slash candidate navigates without writing.
- **Simplification**: Reused the existing completion table and namespace properties; no Store mutation, parent entity, index or dependency.
- **Verification**: focused ERT 20/20; full ERT 352/352; basic and Corfu/orderless CAPF protocols; byte compilation, `check-parens`, `git diff --check`; generated `.elc` removed.
- **Remaining**: issue009 stays open for the user's live popup confirmation.

## 2026-08-01 (task015)

- **Action**: Make nested Tag completion and input navigate one namespace level at a time.
- **Files**:
  - Modify path helpers, completion, shared UI services, Tag command/capture/query/automation readers
  - Modify Schema/View/Table tag selectors and nested-tag completion tests
  - Update nested-tag issue, spec, task and change indexes
- **Behavior**:
  - `#a/` lists only direct children under `a/`; unrelated root Tags are excluded by the completion-table protocol.
  - Slash-terminated candidates navigate without writing; full real paths remain the only stored Tag IDs.
  - Normal candidates have no `[tag]` suffix; only a typed new path receives `[New]`.
  - Add/Change/Capture/Tag Field and query/view selectors share the same hierarchical reader.
- **Simplification**: One pure direct-child helper and one shared reader; no cache, index, Store field, namespace entity or dependency.
- **Verification**: focused ERT 19/19; related View/Query ERT 54/54; full ERT 335/335; completion/inline self-checks; byte compilation, `check-parens`, `git diff --check`; independent review approved.
- **Remaining**: issue009 stays open until the user confirms the corrected popup in their live Corfu configuration.

## 2026-07-29 (task013)

- **Action**: Complete nested tags from authoritative Store synchronization through
  Schema/completion/View/Table interaction and transactional branch rename.
- **Files**:
  - Add `supertag-core-tag-path.el`
  - Modify sync, tag ops/merge, completion, Schema/View/Table and exact text helpers
  - Expand `test/tag-path-test.el` and current phase/spec/issue/change docs
- **Behavior**:
  - Full paths remain canonical IDs; missing parents are virtual namespaces.
  - Namespace aggregation is explicit and read-only in Table; `:extends` remains inheritance.
  - Branch rename migrates descendants and typed tag references with collision/file rollback guards.
  - Exact delete/rename cannot truncate descendant tokens.
- **Verification**: nested-path ERT 15/15; full ERT 330/330; completion/Table
  checks; byte compile/check-parens/diff check; current real vault copy read-only
  verification; Schema visual verdict 92/100.
- **Remaining**: issue009 awaits user interaction confirmation; issue022 retains
  the separate `lazy-convert` file mutation contract.

## 2026-07-29

- **Action**: Replace the leaf-tag proposal with canonical full-path Tag IDs and implement explicit descendant queries.
- **Files**:
  - Modify `supertag-core-scan.el`
  - Modify `supertag-view-api.el`
  - Add `test/tag-path-test.el`
  - Modify `test/run-tests.sh`
  - Modify nested-tag decision/issue and current phase docs
- **Behavior**:
  - Exact tag queries remain exact by default.
  - Optional descendant queries respect `/` segment boundaries.
  - `:extends` remains schema inheritance; no Store migration, parent entity creation, or raw-path double-write occurs.
- **Verification**: focused ERT 4/4; full ERT 319/319; 10k-node benchmark about 24.86ms per descendant query.

## 2026-06-24

- **Action**: Add tech-refer for issue009 nested tags; update issue and ISSUES index.
- **Files**:
  - Add `.phrase/docs/tech-refer_nested_tags_20260624.md`
  - Modify `.phrase/docs/issue_nested_tags_20260624.md` (Investigation, Fix, Verification sections)
  - Modify `.phrase/docs/ISSUES.md` (update issue009 description)
- **Scope**: Documentation only; no code changes.
- **Behavior/Risk**: Establishes recommended approach (store leaf tag in node `:tags`, keep raw path in `:raw-tag-paths`, opt-in via `supertag-sync-nested-tags`). Decision pending user confirmation before implementation.

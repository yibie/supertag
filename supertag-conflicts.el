;;; supertag-conflicts.el --- Review and resolve semantic sync conflicts -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; P1-5 of archive/legacy-v2/2026-08-25-phrase/phases/phase-git-sync-20260713/PLAN.md's review list:
;; `supertag-merge.el' (S3) already records true semantic merge conflicts
;; into a `:sync-conflicts' store collection -- see its Commentary section
;; "Conflict representation" for the exact record shape and id scheme this
;; file reads -- but until now nothing let a user SEE or RESOLVE them. This
;; file closes that loop, per the plan's "真冲突的呈现" ("How true conflicts
;; are surfaced") normative requirement (PLAN.md around line 163): load-time
;; message + doctor section (see supertag-doctor.el's "9. Sync Conflicts")
;; + an interactive per-key resolve command / manual edit.
;;
;; ## Record shape (frozen by supertag-merge.el; summarized here for
;; reference, not redefined):
;;
;;   (:id ID :collection C :entity-id ID-OR-NIL :key K-OR-NIL
;;    :ours V1 :theirs V2 :base V0 :kind :field-conflict|:delete-vs-modify
;;    :detected-at nil)
;;
;; C/ENTITY-ID/KEY vary by conflict shape:
;;   - C nil, ENTITY-ID nil, KEY a keyword: a root scalar conflict (e.g.
;;     `:version') -- applies directly to a top-level key of `supertag--store'.
;;   - C a normal collection (`:nodes' etc.), ENTITY-ID set, KEY nil: a
;;     whole-entity conflict (`:kind' is still `:field-conflict' for this
;;     shape, OR `:delete-vs-modify' when one side deleted the entity) --
;;     V1/V2 are the entity's entire data (or the absent-placeholder below).
;;   - C a normal collection, ENTITY-ID set, KEY a keyword equal to
;;     `supertag--persistence--hash-marker' (`:supertag-hash-table'): a
;;     `:field-values'/legacy-`:fields' entity is stored as a raw hash
;;     table, which freezes to a plist with exactly that one pseudo-key --
;;     so this is ALSO whole-entity-value granularity in disguise (see
;;     supertag-merge.el's Commentary "Conflict granularity" point 2).
;;   - C a normal collection, ENTITY-ID set, KEY any other keyword: an
;;     ordinary field-level conflict on that entity's plist.
;;   - C `:tag-field-associations', ENTITY-ID a tag-id, KEY a string
;;     field-id: one association slot's whole plist conflicted (`:kind' is
;;     `:field-conflict' or `:delete-vs-modify', the latter when one side
;;     dropped that field-id from the tag).
;;   - C `:tag-field-associations', ENTITY-ID a tag-id, KEY `:order': the
;;     ordered-set's LIST ORDER conflicted -- V1/V2/V0 are ordered lists of
;;     field-id STRINGS, not association plists.
;;
;; A deleted side (in a `:delete-vs-modify' record, at either whole-entity
;; or tag-field-associations-slot granularity) is recorded as the keyword
;; `:supertag-merge/absent' (`supertag-merge--absent-placeholder' in
;; supertag-merge.el). This file intentionally does NOT `require' that
;; module to get the constant: supertag-merge.el is designed as an
;; independent batch/merge-driver tool (it even calls `package-initialize'
;; at load time, guarded, for that standalone use) that nothing else in the
;; runtime requires; pulling it into the normal Emacs startup path just for
;; one literal keyword would be exactly the kind of load-order coupling
;; this feature must avoid. The keyword itself is duplicated instead (see
;; `supertag-conflicts--absent-placeholder' below), documented so the two
;; can't silently drift without a human noticing.
;;
;; ## Nested-leaf records (`:key-path')
;;
;; supertag-merge.el now recurses INTO a frozen hash-table entity's own map
;; (`:field-values', legacy `:fields') instead of only ever producing one
;; whole-entity conflict for it -- see its Commentary, "Conflict
;; granularity" point 2, and `supertag-merge--merge-hash-marker-map'. A true
;; leaf-level disagreement found that way is still shaped like an ordinary
;; field-conflict record (`:collection'/`:entity-id'/`:key' read exactly
;; like a non-nested one), PLUS an additive `:key-path' property: the full
;; list of ALIST-key segments from the entity down to the leaf (`:key' is
;; always `:key-path''s own last element) -- e.g. `:collection :fields
;; :entity-id "node1" :key "status" :key-path ("project" "status")', id
;; "fields/node1/project/status". The OLD whole-entity-value shape (`:key'
;; equal to `supertag--persistence--hash-marker', no `:key-path' at all)
;; can still occur for a collection whose entity value is not hash-marker-
;; shaped on some side (the safety net in
;; `supertag-merge--decompose-conflict') -- both shapes are handled here,
;; by different apply paths (`supertag-conflicts--resolve-hash-entity-one'
;; for the old whole-value shape, `supertag-conflicts--apply-nested-leaf'
;; for the new `:key-path' shape), dispatched on which property the record
;; actually carries.
;;
;; `supertag-conflicts--apply-nested-leaf' resolves a `:key-path' record
;; through the SAME collection-specific store seam a live write would use
;; (`supertag-store-put-legacy-field'/`-remove-legacy-field' for `:fields',
;; `supertag-store-put-field-value'/`-remove-field-value' for
;; `:field-values') rather than hand-walking the live nested hash tables --
;; see that function's own docstring for why this is safe (both seams
;; create missing intermediate levels the same way a fresh write would, and
;; both have participated in `supertag-with-transaction''s rollback log
;; since P1-4), and doctor rendering needs no changes at all: the section
;; renders each conflict's own `:id' verbatim, and
;; `supertag-merge--path-conflict-id' already produces the readable
;; "fields/node1/project/status" form for these records.
;;
;; ## Load-time visibility (hook choice, justified)
;;
;; supertag-core-persistence.el must not `require' this file. Rather than
;; the alternative (a fboundp-guarded check bolted onto supertag.el's
;; `supertag-init', which only covers ONE of the several places
;; `supertag-load-store' is actually called from -- see also
;; `supertag-vault-activate') this file instead hooks onto
;; `supertag-persistence-after-load-hook', a normal hook that
;; supertag-core-persistence.el runs (via `run-hooks', not knowing or
;; caring who is listening) at the tail of every SUCCESSFUL
;; `supertag-load-store' call. This is the exact same idiom already
;; established in this codebase for this exact kind of problem:
;; `supertag-git.el' hooks `supertag-git-sync--on-db-saved' onto the
;; symmetric `supertag-persistence-after-save-hook' the same way, and
;; supertag-core-persistence.el is none the wiser about either listener.
;; The only requirement this places on load order is that THIS file be
;; `require'd (directly or transitively) before the first
;; `supertag-load-store' call happens to run -- true for the normal
;; `supertag.el' startup path (which requires this file alongside its
;; other core-tier modules), and something any other caller (a test, a
;; batch script) opts into explicitly by requiring this file too.

  "Apply resolved VALUE to a granular `:key-path' leaf conflict.
COLLECTION/ENTITY-ID/KEY-PATH identify the leaf exactly as recorded by
`supertag-merge--make-path-conflict' (see this file's Commentary,
\"Nested-leaf records\"). KEY-PATH is the list of ALIST-key segments
beneath ENTITY-ID: for the legacy `:fields' collection that is
`(TAG-ID FIELD-NAME)' (two segments -- `:fields' nests node -> tag ->
field), and for `:field-values' it is `(FIELD-ID)' (one segment --
`:field-values' nests node -> field only); see
`supertag-store-put-legacy-field'/`-remove-legacy-field' and
`supertag-store-put-field-value'/`-remove-field-value' in
supertag-core-store.el, whose own argument lists mirror this nesting
exactly. VALUE equal to `supertag-conflicts--absent-placeholder' means
remove the leaf (a delete-vs-modify record's missing side); anything
else is the leaf's new value, thawed via
`supertag--persistence--thaw-value' first (mirrors the ordinary
plist-field path in `supertag-conflicts--apply' below).

Routed through those collection-specific seams rather than a hand-rolled
walk of the live nested hash tables: both seams already (a) create every
missing intermediate level on demand, exactly like a fresh write would
(so use-ours/use-theirs/edit-value all work even when a level was pruned
away since the merge), and (b) have, since P1-4, recorded every level
they touch into the active `supertag-with-transaction' rollback log
themselves (`supertag--transaction-restore-entry' understands the
`(:fields NODE TAG FIELD)'/`(:fields NODE TAG)'/`(:fields NODE)' and
`(:field-values NODE FIELD)' path shapes) -- so the caller
(`supertag-conflicts--resolve-one') gets the same atomic
apply-and-remove-record guarantee as the ordinary plist-field path
merely by calling this from inside its existing `supertag-with-transaction'
block, with none of this file's own hand-rolled capture/restore (compare
`supertag-conflicts--resolve-hash-entity-one', whose target -- an entire
raw hash table with no per-level seam -- has no such seam to route
through and must capture/restore by hand instead).

Neither seam creates or removes a leaf's own removal side-effects
(`:store-changed'/dirty-marking) uniformly: `supertag-store-put-field-value'/
`-remove-field-value' do (an explicit EMIT-EVENT-P argument for the
put, unconditionally for the remove), matching every other collection
this file resolves against; `supertag-store-put-legacy-field'/
`-remove-legacy-field' are the bare transactional seam only (real
callers layer `supertag-ops-commit' on top for that -- see
supertag-ops-field.el), so this function marks the store dirty and
emits `:store-changed' itself for `:fields', mirroring
`supertag-conflicts--resolve-hash-entity-one''s manual final step."

  "Resolve the `:sync-conflicts' entity ID via ACTION.
ACTION is one of `:use-ours', `:use-theirs', `:edit', or `:drop'. VALUE
supplies the replacement when ACTION is `:edit' (ignored otherwise).

Atomic per call: applying the resolved value to its target entity AND
removing the conflict record happen inside one `supertag-with-transaction'
-- an error part-way through rolls back both, leaving the target entity
and the conflict record exactly as they were.

When the conflict's target no longer exists (its owning entity was
deleted since the merge -- e.g. the user deleted the node), silently
downgrades to `:drop' regardless of the requested ACTION: there is
nothing left to apply the value to, so the only sane resolution is
dropping the stale record.

Returns `:applied', `:dropped', or `:not-found' (ID was already gone from
`:sync-conflicts', e.g. resolved by a concurrent call)."

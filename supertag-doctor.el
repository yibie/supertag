;;; supertag-doctor.el --- Health check and repair for Supertag -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Keywords: convenience

;;; Commentary:

;; `supertag-doctor' is an interactive health-check command for the
;; Supertag persistence layer.  It inspects the on-disk database
;; file(s), in-memory store guards, lock state, data version, and
;; referential integrity, then renders a report to the
;; "*Supertag Doctor*" buffer.
;;
;; Unless called with a prefix argument (or running in batch mode via
;; `noninteractive'), it will additionally offer to run a series of
;; known-safe repair commands, prompting with `y-or-n-p' before each
;; one, and appending what was run to the report buffer.
;;
;; Every check is written to degrade gracefully: if a given helper
;; function or variable is not available (e.g. because a module has
;; not been loaded, or was renamed upstream), the corresponding line
;; reports "n/a (helper not available)" instead of erroring, so the
;; command is always safe to run.

;;; supertag-git.el --- Git integration for the supertag-db semantic merge driver -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; S3b of archive/legacy-v2/2026-08-25-phrase/phases/phase-git-sync-20260713/PLAN.md ("S3 语义 merge
;; driver" -> everything except the pure merge core itself, which is
;; `supertag-merge.el', S3a). This file wires that pure core into a real git
;; checkout: `.gitattributes', **per-clone** `.git/config' merge-driver
;; configuration, `.gitignore' for local-only state, and the
;; `supertag-git-check' diagnostic plist consumed by both `supertag-git-setup'
;; itself and `supertag-doctor'.
;;
;; ## Scope: the full S4 "one URL" user journey, end-to-end
;;
;; This file implements the whole of the plan's "S4 用户旅程" (S3b's
;; original per-clone-plumbing scope, described just below, plus
;; everything S4 added on top of it): repo-layout migration (moving
;; `supertag-db-file' into a vault-rooted `.supertag/' directory --
;; `supertag-git--migrate-layout'), machine 1's `supertag-git-setup'
;; driving that migration through an initial commit, `remote add`/
;; `set-url', and `push -u`, machine N's `supertag-git-clone', and the
;; opt-in `supertag-git-sync-mode' auto commit/fetch/merge/push loop. See
;; the plan's "S4 用户旅程" section for the full user-facing narrative.
;;
;; ## V1 limitation: single-root vaults only
;;
;; Per the plan's explicit decision, git sync in this version only supports
;; a vault backed by a SINGLE `supertag-sync-directories' root (or none
;; configured at all, in which case the database's own directory is used).
;; Multiple configured roots are refused outright rather than guessed at —
;; seeing `archive/legacy-v2/2026-08-25-phrase/phases/phase-git-sync-20260713/PLAN.md' section "S4 用户
;; 旅程" / "V1 限制" is the documented escape hatch (consolidate to one root,
;; or do not enable git sync yet).
;;
;; ## Why the driver must be configured on EVERY clone
;;
;; `.gitattributes' (which path uses which merge driver) is a tracked file
;; and travels with the repository. `merge.<name>.driver' (what command that
;; driver actually runs) lives in `.git/config', which git NEVER syncs
;; between clones — and the command line this file writes there embeds an
;; absolute, machine-local path to wherever `supertag-merge.el' happens to
;; live on THIS machine (found via `locate-library', which walks
;; `load-path'). This is, per the plan, the single easiest step to forget;
;; `supertag-git-check' (and `supertag-doctor' section 8) exist specifically
;; to make the omission visible instead of silently degrading (see
;; "Degradation" below).
;;
;; ## Degradation when the driver is NOT configured
;;
;; This is not a bolted-on fallback; it falls directly out of S2's
;; canonical, one-entity-per-line database format (see the commentary above
;; `supertag--persistence-canonical-format-header' in
;; supertag-core-persistence.el). Even with `.gitattributes' pointing at an
;; undefined driver name (or no `.gitattributes' entry at all), git's own
;; default line-oriented 3-way text merge already converges cleanly whenever
;; two sides touched DIFFERENT entities/lines — only an edit to the SAME
;; line (the same entity) produces literal `<<<<<<<'/`=======' /`>>>>>>>'
;; markers inside the file. `supertag-core-persistence.el''s loader
;; (`supertag--persistence--try-read-store', via
;; `supertag--persistence--buffer-has-conflict-markers-p') detects that case
;; and refuses to load the file with a message pointing back at
;; `supertag-git-setup' and `git checkout --merge', rather than silently
;; treating a conflict-marked file as an empty store (see that file's
;; commentary for how this interacts with the candidate-fallback/
;; protective-skip load and save paths).
;;
;; ## Package-manager independence
;;
;; This file is intentionally NOT part of the same require chain as
;; `supertag.el' proper (no `org' integration, no UI) so that
;; `supertag-git-check' stays cheap to call from `supertag-doctor', and so
;; the driver command line this file writes only ever needs `-L
;; <package-dir>' (see `supertag-git--package-dir'), matching the
;; independently-documented invocation at the top of `supertag-merge.el'.

;; --- Free-variable declarations for symbols owned by supertag.el /
;; supertag-services-sync.el ---
;;
;; This file deliberately does NOT `require' `supertag' or
;; `supertag-services-sync' (see the Commentary, "Package-manager
;; independence"): every reference to a symbol owned by either of those
;; files below is guarded at runtime with `boundp'/`fboundp' and simply
;; degrades to a no-op when that fuller package has not been loaded (e.g. a
;; standalone batch test of just this file). A plain, value-less `defvar'
;; changes nothing about that behavior; it only tells the byte-compiler
;; these symbols are genuinely special (dynamically bound) variables, which
;; matters in exactly one place below: `supertag-git--apply-data-directory-wiring'
;; binds `supertag--config-guard-allow' with a plain `let' to replicate
;; `supertag-config-guard--with-allow' (supertag.el's own macro, which
;; this file cannot call directly without requiring that whole package —
;; see that function's docstring). Under `lexical-binding: t' (this file's
;; default), a `let' on an UNDECLARED symbol creates an ordinary lexical
;; binding instead of a dynamic one — invisible to supertag.el's own
;; `supertag-config-guard--watch', which reads the symbol dynamically —
;; silently defeating the bypass in compiled code specifically (interpreted
;; code would happen to work, which is exactly the kind of latent
;; compile/interpret divergence this declaration exists to prevent; see
;; test/git-integration-test.el's identical technique/rationale for
;; `supertag-sync-directories'). Plain reads/writes of the other
;; symbols below never need this treatment (proven empirically: a
;; `boundp'/`fboundp'-guarded read or `setq' of an undeclared symbol
;; compiles warning-free; only `let'-binding one does not).

harness (`supertag-git--configure-clone' factored out specifically so
tests exercise the exact same configuration logic setup does, per the
plan).

Only touches `.gitattributes' and `.gitignore' (working-tree files, safe
to `git add') plus THIS repo's local `.git/config' -- never runs `git add'

REPO-ROOT and DB-FILE are both resolved through `file-truename' before
the relative `.gitattributes' path is computed: REPO-ROOT frequently
arrives as a truename already (everything derived from
`supertag-git--repo-toplevel' is -- git prints resolved paths), while
DB-FILE typically arrives as the user-configured, possibly
symlink-traversing spelling (`/tmp/...' vs `/private/tmp/...' on macOS

;;; --- S4 vault layout migration (DB must live INSIDE the repo) ---
;;
;; Per the plan's "S4 用户旅程" -> "仓库布局": the merge driver requires the
;; database file to be a tracked, in-repo path, but the pre-S4 common case
;; is a database living at `~/.emacs.d/supertag/' -- entirely outside
;; whatever git repository the user's `.org' vault lives in. Migration is:
;;
;;   0. if the LIVE in-memory store has unsaved changes (`supertag-dirty-p'),
;;      flush them to the OLD file first via the normal `supertag-save-store'
;;      path, then re-check `supertag-dirty-p' -- a save that is silently
;;      skipped (guard violation, lock conflict, protective empty-store
;;      skip, ...) still leaves the flag set, and that must ABORT the
;;      migration rather than let step 1 below copy a database that does
;;      not reflect what is actually in memory (see
;;      `supertag--persistence-guard-violations' for the reasons named in
;;      the abort message).
;;   1. write the NEW database from the CURRENT in-memory store directly,
;;      via `supertag--persistence-write-store-atomically' -- never a
;;      `copy-file' of whatever the OLD file happens to contain on disk,
;;      which (even after step 0's flush) is one extra hop removed from
;;      "what is actually in memory right now". `copy-file' is used ONLY
;;      as a fallback for the case where no store has been loaded into
;;      this session at all yet (so there is no in-memory store to
;;      serialize from).
;;   2. verify the new file is loadable (never trust a bare `copy-file' or
;;      a bare atomic write without reading it back)
;;   3. only once verified: flip this session's persistence wiring
;;      (`supertag-data-directory'/`supertag-db-file'/etc, the same
;;      config-guard-bypassed pattern `supertag-vault--apply' uses),
;;      reload the live store from the new location, and confirm BOTH that
;;      the reload's recorded origin status is `:ok' AND (when a store was
;;      already loaded pre-migration) that its node count matches the
;;      pre-migration count captured in step 0 -- any disagreement aborts
;;      exactly like a failed verification would.
;;   4. only once step 3 has itself fully succeeded: rename (never delete)
;;      the OLD database file to a `.migrated-<timestamp>' tombstone
;;
;; Any failure at or after the wiring flip in step 3 restores this
;; session's wiring to its pre-migration snapshot (`supertag-git--capture-wiring'
;; / `supertag-git--restore-wiring') and reloads the store from the
;; (now-restored) OLD file, via an `unwind-protect' state machine -- so a
;; failure never leaves the session pointed at a new file while the OLD
;; file (and whatever real data it holds) sits untouched and unreferenced.

(defun supertag-git-setup ()
  "Configure the current vault's git repository for semantic supertag-db merges.

Idempotent: safe to run again on this same clone (it will report what it
already had configured and skip re-adding duplicate lines), and this is
also the command every OTHER clone/machine must run once for itself --
`merge.supertag-db.driver' lives in `.git/config', which git never syncs
between clones (see the Commentary in this file for why).

Steps performed (each reported as it happens):
1. Locate `supertag-db-file''s directory; if it is not already inside a
   git worktree, offer to `git init' one -- at the single configured
   `supertag-sync-directories' root if there is exactly one and it
   already contains the database, otherwise by prompting (refusing
   outright, rather than guessing, when multiple sync roots are
   configured or no in-repo root can be inferred; see
   `supertag-git-setup--pick-root').
2. Write/append a `.gitattributes' entry marking the database's path for
   the `supertag-db' merge driver.
3. Write THIS CLONE's `.git/config' `merge.supertag-db.*' entries,
   pointing at wherever `supertag-merge.el' lives on THIS machine.
4. Append `.gitignore' entries (local-only state that must never be
   synced) next to the database file.
5. Prompt for an `origin' remote URL (pre-filled with whatever is already
   configured, if anything; empty input explicitly skips this and every
   remaining step below, leaving a valid local-only vault -- see
   `supertag-git-setup--configure-remote'). When a URL is given: configure
   it (`git remote add`, or `set-url` with confirmation if `origin'
   already pointed somewhere else), create the vault's initial commit via
   the exact same scoped-staging pathspec logic `supertag-git-sync-mode'
   uses for its own auto-commits (`supertag-git-setup--commit-all' /
   `supertag-git-sync--commit-pathspecs' -- never a bare `git add -A'),
   then `git push -u origin <current-branch>'. A push failure (almost
   always auth/network: no ssh-agent, no credential helper, unreachable
   host, ...) is reported as a diagnostic pointing at manual `git push'
   troubleshooting -- this step never retries.

Also performs, as its new Step 0 (S4), a one-time vault layout migration
when `supertag-db-file' lives outside any git repository but a single
`supertag-sync-directories' root is configured: the database is
copied to `<root>/.supertag/supertag-db.el', verified loadable, this
session's persistence wiring is switched over and the store reloaded from
the new location, and only then is the OLD file renamed (never deleted) to
a `.migrated-<timestamp>' tombstone -- see `supertag-git--migrate-layout'
for the full decision table and `supertag-git--do-migrate-layout' for the
failure-safety chain. Idempotent like everything else here: once migrated,
subsequent runs see the database already inside the repo and skip this
step. Still refuses outright (unchanged from before S4) if, after that
migration step, the database turns out to live outside the git repo it
finds/creates -- e.g. multiple sync roots configured (V1 limitation) or no
root at all with a non-interactive caller."

This is machine N of the plan's \"一个 URL 完成配置\" (\"one URL to

machine 1, which already pushed a vault laid out per
`supertag-git--migrate-layout''s `<repo-root>/.supertag/supertag-db.el'
convention.

Steps:
1. `git clone REMOTE-URL LOCAL-DIRECTORY' (refuses if LOCAL-DIRECTORY
   already exists and is non-empty, rather than cloning into it and
   producing a confusing git error).
2. Configure THIS clone's merge driver + `.gitattributes'/`.gitignore' for

   (`supertag-git--configure-clone', the exact same per-clone step
   `supertag-git-setup' performs -- required on every machine regardless
   of who ran `supertag-git-setup' originally, see this file's Commentary
   on why).
3. Register LOCAL-DIRECTORY as this session's vault
   (`supertag-git--register-vault-root').
4. Load the database from `.supertag/supertag-db.el' if it exists and
   parses; otherwise (missing, e.g. a fresh empty remote, or corrupt)
   reindex Document Projections from the cloned Org files
   (`supertag-git--reindex-org-files').  This cannot restore Semantic Facts.
5. Report the resulting node/tag counts.

;;; --- supertag-git-sync-mode: automatic commit/fetch/merge/push loop (S4) ---
;;
;; Off by default (opt-in). Correctness lives entirely in the merge driver
;; (S3/supertag-merge.el) and the vault layout (S4 above) -- this mode is
;; purely a convenience automation layer on top of both; a user who prefers
;; to `magit-push'/`magit-pull' by hand gets identical correctness with
;; this mode left off.
;;
;; ## Serialization (no queue engineering, per the plan)
;;
;; Exactly one git operation chain (commit-then-push, or fetch-then-maybe-
;; merge, or a push's own fetch/merge/retry) runs at a time, guarded by the
;; single flag `supertag-git-sync--in-flight'. A trigger that arrives while
;; busy is simply DROPPED -- not queued -- on the understanding that the
;; next timer tick (pull every `supertag-git-sync-pull-interval' seconds;
;; commit debounce restarts on every new change anyway) will catch
;; whatever was missed. This is a deliberate simplicity choice, not an
;; oversight.
;;
;; ## Async, never blocking (with a synchronous escape hatch for tests)
;;
;; All git subprocess calls in this section go through
;; `supertag-git-sync--run-git', which uses `make-process' (never
;; blocking the UI thread) UNLESS `supertag-git-sync--synchronous' is
;; non-nil, in which case it uses a blocking `call-process' instead. Batch
;; ERT tests cannot pump Emacs' normal command loop the way an interactive
;; session does (process sentinels only run between commands / during
;; `sit-for'/`accept-process-output'), so this file's own tests `let'-bind
;; that variable to drive the exact same callback-continuation code
;; deterministically, per this task's explicit instructions. Production
;; code never sets it.

the push-reject retry path. Runs regardless of MERGE-RESULT's exit code
\(unlike an earlier version of this function): a merge that leaves `.org'
text conflicts is EXACTLY the case this function most needs to react to,
and git reports that outcome via a non-zero `git merge' exit -- gating
this function on success would skip conflict detection in precisely the
scenario it exists for.
- Reload the store (`supertag-load-store', which also refreshes the
  multi-instance lock and cross-machine presence) whenever
  `supertag-db-file' itself is NOT among the still-unmerged paths -- the
  common case, since the merge driver (or, absent one, a clean disjoint
  text-merge) resolves it automatically even when other paths in the same
  merge are left conflicted. A harmless no-op reload when the database
  did not actually change.
- Recompute `supertag-git-sync--conflicted-org-files' fresh via
  `supertag-git-sync--live-conflicted-org-files' (so the advice below
  refuses to let the sync scanner import any still-conflicted file)

(define-minor-mode supertag-git-sync-mode
  "Automatic Git commit/fetch/merge/push loop for the current Supertag vault.
This opt-in mode is disabled by default.  See this file's Commentary for the
serialization, asynchronous operation, and offline-degradation design.

While enabled:
- Saving the database (`supertag-save-store' succeeding) or any file
  inside the vault schedules a debounced (`supertag-git-sync-commit-debounce'
  seconds) scoped `git add -A --' + commit (skipped when nothing is
  actually staged), followed by a push. Staging is deliberately narrow --
  ONLY `.org' files, `supertag-db-file' itself, and `.gitattributes'/
  `.gitignore' (see `supertag-git-sync--commit-pathspecs') -- so any OTHER
  untracked file inside the vault (credentials, attachments, IDE/OS junk,
  ...) is never swept into an automatic commit. The commit is refused
  entirely, with a one-shot warning, whenever the repository still has
  unresolved conflicted paths from a merge (in this session, an earlier
  one, or outside Emacs) -- staging over that would mark the conflict
  resolved and commit literal `<<<<<<<' markers into history; see
  `supertag-git-sync--fire-commit'.
- Every `supertag-git-sync-pull-interval' seconds, and at most once every
  `supertag-git-sync-focus-pull-min-interval' seconds on regaining focus,
  this fetches, merges (never rebases) if behind, and then PUSHES if
  ahead (P1-7) -- both the ahead and behind counts are re-derived fresh
  from git (`git rev-list --count`) every cycle, never trusted from a
  session-local counter alone. This is what makes a period offline (or a
  push that never finished before Emacs quit) recover on its own: the
  very next successful fetch after connectivity returns also pushes
  whatever commits piled up locally, without waiting for a brand new
  edit.
- Enabling the mode itself immediately performs this same ahead check and
  pushes right away if needed, so a fresh Emacs session never orphans
  commits a previous session made but could not push in time.
- The modeline lighter's pending count (\" STG\\u2191N\") is a DISPLAY
  CACHE refreshed from that same git-derived ahead count every cycle --
  after a restart it shows the true number as soon as the first cycle
  runs, rather than lying with 0 the way a purely session-local counter
  would.
- A rejected push retries once (fetch+merge+push); repeated failure or any
  network-looking failure degrades silently to local-only commits, with
  the pending count shown in the lighter.
- Org files left with unresolved merge conflict markers are never
  imported by the sync scanner; see M-x supertag-doctor, which derives
  this status FRESH from git every time it is run (survives an Emacs
  restart), not merely from this session's cache.

Disabling cancels all timers (flushing any pending debounced commit
first), removes all hooks/advice, and clears vault state."

;;; canonical-serialization-test.el --- ERT tests for S2 canonical DB serialization -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Regression tests for the S2 "canonical, deterministic, line-per-entity
;; serialization" work (archive/legacy-v2/2026-08-25-phrase/phases/phase-git-sync-20260713/PLAN.md
;; "S2 规范化序列化"): the on-disk DB format written by
;; `supertag--persistence-write-store-atomically' must be:
;;   - deterministic: same logical content -> byte-identical file, on any
;;     machine, regardless of hash-table/insertion iteration order;
;;   - line-per-entity: one `git diff' line per changed entity/field;
;;   - loadable both ways: old (single prin1 hash-table) files still load,
;;     and this build's saves are readable by the format-detecting loader.
;;
;; Every test runs inside an isolated temp directory; none of them ever
;; touch the user's real `~/.emacs.d'.
;;
;; Run:
;;   ./test/run-tests.sh canon
;;   emacs -batch -L . --eval "(package-initialize)" \
;;     -l test/canonical-serialization-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit

BODY is `byte-compile'd exactly ONCE into a zero-arg closure, then each

`funcall' of that closure — see test/perf-benchmark.el's
`supertag-perf-benchmark--measure' for the full rationale (this is the
same pattern, copied because this test file intentionally avoids
requiring the heavier perf-benchmark.el).

This indirection is NOT optional here: the canonicalizer measured ~4x
slower interpreted than byte-compiled in practice while
developing this guard, and test/run-tests.sh never byte-compiles source
files before loading them — so comparing an interpreted canonical writer
against the plain `prin1' PRIMITIVE (whose own speed does not depend on
the calling code's compilation state at all) would make this perf guard
pass or fail based on whether a stray `.elc' happened to be lying around,
not on the actual cost of the canonical format. Compiling both sides of
the comparison here makes the result reproducible regardless of that."

;;; conflicts-test.el --- ERT tests for supertag-conflicts.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Regression tests for P1-5 of .phrase/phases/phase-git-sync-20260713/PLAN.md's
;; review list: closing the loop on `:sync-conflicts' records that
;; supertag-merge.el (S3) already writes but that nothing previously let a
;; user see or resolve.
;;
;; Every conflict fixture below is built by actually running
;; `supertag-merge-3way' over crafted base/ours/theirs inputs (writing the
;; merged result through the real canonical writer and back in via
;; `supertag-load-store'), NOT by hand-assembling `:sync-conflicts' plists --
;; so these tests break if supertag-merge.el's record shape ever drifts,
;; per the review item's explicit instruction.
;;
;; Every test runs inside an isolated temp directory/store; none of them
;; ever touch the user's real `~/.emacs.d'. Follows the
;; `tx-test--with-temp-env' / `supertag-hardening-test--with-temp-env'
;; fixture pattern from test/transaction-test.el and
;; test/persistence-hardening-test.el.
;;
;; Run:
;;   ./test/run-tests.sh conflicts
;;   emacs -batch -L . --eval "(package-initialize)" \
;;     -l test/conflicts-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit

real, globally-registered `supertag-conflicts--notify-after-load' listener
to fire, to prove the load-time visibility wiring actually works end to
end.

Also neutralizes the sync-state-layer save guard for the whole BODY (not
just one `supertag-load-store' call): `supertag--persistence-guard-violations'
refuses to save whenever it thinks the sync-state layer has not been
loaded for the current vault, which -- exactly as noted in
test/persistence-hardening-test.el's own auto-migrate test -- always fires
in an isolated test that never loads the sync module. These tests need
real, un-skipped saves to actually happen (to verify the \"after each
resolution batch: supertag-save-store\" requirement), so this guard is
neutralized for the whole fixture rather than just around one call."

;; Before supertag-merge.el learned to recurse into a hash-shaped entity's
;; own map, ANY conflicting `:field-values'/legacy-`:fields' entity produced
;; exactly this shape: one whole-entity conflict keyed by the
;; `:supertag-hash-table' pseudo-key, `:ours'/`:theirs' the entity's own
;; frozen ALIST, no `:key-path' at all. A real `supertag-merge-3way' run can
;; no longer produce this shape for these two collections: the entity-level
;; decompose dispatch sees any hash-marker value as plist-like (a
;; 2-element list, keyword at index 0) and always takes the
;; field-level-merge path, which always recurses at the
;; `:supertag-hash-table' pseudo-key whenever both sides' values there are
;; lists (see `supertag-merge--field-level-merge') -- true for every
;; genuinely hash-shaped entity, so every conflict on one decomposes at
;; least one level further now. `supertag-conflicts--resolve-hash-entity-one'
;; is still reachable in principle (a `:sync-conflicts' record written by
;; an older version of supertag-merge.el, still sitting unresolved in
;; someone's store from before this fix, or any future collection whose
;; entity-level safety net still emits this shape), so this test

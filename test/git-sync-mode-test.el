;;; git-sync-mode-test.el --- Tests for the S4 vault migration, clone, and auto-sync loop -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; S4 of .phrase/phases/phase-git-sync-20260713/PLAN.md ("S4 用户旅程" /
;; "S4 自动同步循环"). Covers the three additions this phase makes to
;; `supertag-git.el':
;;
;;   1. vault layout migration (`supertag-git--migrate-layout' /
;;      `supertag-git--do-migrate-layout', wired into `supertag-git-setup')
;;   2. `supertag-git-clone'
;;   3. `supertag-git-sync-mode' (the debounced commit / periodic pull /
;;      push-reject-retry / offline-degradation / org-text-conflict-guard
;;      automatic loop)
;;
;; Like test/git-integration-test.el, every test here drives a REAL `git'
;; binary against real temp-directory repositories (skipped via `ert-skip'
;; when `git' is not on `exec-path') -- this suite specifically is about
;; proving the wiring into real git plumbing, not re-testing the pure merge
;; core (already covered by test/merge-test.el) or the per-clone
;; `.gitattributes'/`.gitignore'/driver configuration (already covered by
;; test/git-integration-test.el).
;;
;; ## Batch-safety for `supertag-git-sync-mode'
;;
;; `supertag-git-sync-mode' normally runs all git operations
;; asynchronously (`make-process') and reacts to real timers/focus events.
;; Neither works deterministically in `ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit' (no
;; command loop pumping process sentinels, no real user focus events), so
;; every test below that touches the mode's machinery binds
;; `supertag-git-sync--synchronous' to t (documented on that variable in
;; supertag-git.el as existing exactly for this purpose) and fires timer
;; FUNCTIONS directly via `funcall'/direct call instead of waiting for
;; `run-with-timer' to elapse, per this task's explicit instructions.
;;
;; Run:
;;   ./test/run-tests.sh git
;;   emacs -batch -L . --eval "(package-initialize)" \
;;     -l test/git-sync-mode-test.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit

;; machines (observed failure: "ld: library 'emutls_w' not found") for
;; reasons entirely unrelated to this test's own logic. Interpreted Lisp
;; (which is what `-l file.el' runs, as opposed to a `.eln'/`.elc') always

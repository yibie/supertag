;;; perf-benchmark.el --- Performance baseline for supertag hot paths -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Establishes a reproducible performance baseline for query, persistence, and
;; view hot paths in supertag, using an isolated in-memory dataset.
;; This file never touches the user's real `~/.emacs.d' data.
;;
;; This is a standalone, batch-runnable benchmark. It is NOT wired into
;; test/run-tests.sh (which only runs deterministic pass/fail ERT suites);
;; run it directly with:
;;
;;   emacs -batch -L . --eval "(package-initialize)" \
;;     -l test/perf-benchmark.el -f supertag-perf-benchmark-run
;;
;; The focused 5,000-node navigation benchmark added for interactive hot paths
;; is independently runnable (and prints only; it writes no report file):
;;
;;   emacs -batch -L . --eval "(package-initialize)" \
;;     -l test/perf-benchmark.el \
;;     -f supertag-perf-benchmark-navigation-hot-paths
;;
;; What it measures (see `supertag-perf-benchmark-run'):
;;   1. `supertag-index-get-nodes-by-tag'  - indexed hot + rare tag lookup
;;   2. `supertag-index-get-nodes-by-word' - O(N) full :nodes scan, substring search
;;   3. `supertag-save-store' / `supertag-load-store' - full DB serialize/read,
;;      including the atomic-save + verify-after-save path
;;   4. `supertag-index-rebuild-relations' - full :relations scan, index rebuild
;;   5. Table view refresh data path (`supertag-view-table--get-entities',
;;      `supertag-view-table--get-columns', `supertag-view-table--build-state')
;;      plus, since it turned out to need no live window, the full
;;      `supertag-view-table--render-table' pass too (see the feasibility
;;      note above `supertag-perf-benchmark--view-refresh-data').
;;   6. Focused navigation entry: warm mention discovery, three-keyword search,
;;      and warm Table state rebuilding across exactly 5,000 synthetic nodes.
;;
;; The dataset (10,000 nodes / 50 tags / ~2,000 relations / fields on ~30%
;; of nodes) is generated purely arithmetically (no `random' calls), so
;; repeated runs produce the exact same dataset shape and hit rates.
;;
;; This is measurement only. No optimization work is done here.

;;; --- Measurement harness ---

(defmacro supertag-perf-benchmark--measure (n &rest body)
  "Run BODY N times, return a list of per-run elapsed wall-clock seconds
\(one float per run, NOT an average).

BODY is byte-compiled exactly ONCE (via `byte-compile', into a zero-arg
closure), so every run times genuinely compiled code, then each of the N
runs is individually timed via `benchmark-run' wrapping a plain `funcall'
of that closure. This two-step approach -- compile once, time N times --
turned out to matter a lot in practice, for two compounding reasons
discovered while developing this file:

1. `benchmark-run-compiled' recompiles its FORMS argument on every macro
   expansion. Naively writing `(benchmark-run-compiled 1 BODY)' inside a
   `(dotimes (_ N) ...)' loop -- i.e. expanding it N times with the real
   BODY inlined -- recompiles the whole benchmarked expression on every
   single run. For a body that scans a 10k-entry hash table this alone
   made even 30 iterations take tens of seconds.
2. Worse, on a native-comp Emacs `benchmark-run-compiled' expands to
   `(benchmark-call (native-compile (quote (lambda () FORMS))) N)' --
   a full native (libgccjit) compilation, not a byte-compile. Invoking
   that on every one of N iterations turned a 300-iteration measurement
   into a multi-minute hang. `native-compile' also compiles from a
   *quoted* lambda, so it cannot see any surrounding lexical `let'
   binding either.

`benchmark-run' (no \"-compiled\") avoids both problems: its macroexpansion
is just `(benchmark-call (lambda () FORMS) N)' -- a plain, real (lexically
closing) closure with no compilation step at all -- so timing N runs of an
already-byte-compiled thunk via `benchmark-run' is cheap and accurate,
while the actual workload under measurement still runs as compiled code."
